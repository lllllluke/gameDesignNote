*Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan 
That is,while there is value in the items on the right, 
we value the items on the left more.*

- **12 principles of agile software**
	1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
	2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
	3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
	4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
	5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
	6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
	7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
	8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
	9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
	10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
	11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
	12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
- some core elements
	- Flexible goals
		- tolerating changes to the plan
		- planning for changes to the plan
	- Prioritized backlog
		- often revisit the backlog and reprioritize the features
		- the most important things will get done first
	- Sprints
		- agile developers work in a series of “sprints,”
		- Nolan Bushnell: “The ultimate inspiration is the deadline,”
		- more deadlines means more things get done
	- Scrum meetings
		- brevity and effectiveness
			- stays aware of what the others are doing
			- get help from team members
		- typically 10–15 minutes long daily
		- each member explains exactly three things
			- what they accomplished yesterday
			- what they plan to accomplish today
			- what problems they are facing
		- after the meeting is over
			- Solutions to these problems are discussed one-on-one by the appropriate team members
	- Demo day
		- At the end of each sprint
		- get together to experiment with what was produced
		- does risk analysis and plan the next sprint
	- Retrospectives
		- at the end of each sprint
		- discuss about the process they are using
		- adjust their process for the next sprint
- all feature risk assessment and prototyping at their core
