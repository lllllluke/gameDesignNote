- Problem statement:
  - Design a “flying dino” game where dinosaurs race in and above the water.
- Detailed problem statements
  - We need to figure out if we can schedule all the animation time needed for the dinosaurs.
  - We need to develop the “right” number of levels for this game
  - We need to figure out all the power-ups that will go into this game
  - We need to determine all the weapons that this game should support (and avoid rapid-fire machine guns because of networking constraints)
