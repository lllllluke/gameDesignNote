- a lot of complex detail
  - risk assessment, prototypes, and looping
- a brief spiral model
  1. Come up with a basic design.
  2. Figure out the greatest risks in your design.
  3. Build prototypes that mitigate those risks.
  4. Test the prototypes.
  5. Come up with a more detailed design based on what you have learned.
  6. Return to step 2.
